different types of machine learning algorithms
I load a customer dataset related to a telecommunication company, clean it, use KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours to predict the category of customers, and evaluate the accuracy of your model.
I learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their respond to different medications. Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
I use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
  the K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.
 I be looking at Agglomerative clustering, which is more popular than Divisive clustering.  We will also be using Complete Linkage as the Linkage Criteria.
 Density-based Clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. Density, in this context, is defined as the number of points within a specified radius.
